Selectors
    -> Universal
        -> Select elements of any type 
        -> Syntax: *

        -> Example
        * {
            color: red;
        }

        *** this means that every element would have the 'color: red;' applied to it ***

    -> Type 
        -> Select element of the given type: for example <div>

        <div>Hello, World!</div>
        <p>Hi...</p>
        <div>Okay, bye.</div>

        -> Example
        div {
            color: red;
        }

        *** this means that every div would have the 'color: red;' applied to it while the <p> element would not have anything applied to it ***

    -> Class
        -> Select elements of a given Class

        <div class="alert-text">Please agree to our terms of service.</div>

        -> Example
        .alert-text {
            color: red;
        }

        *** Syntax: uses a '.' followed by case-sensitive value of the class attribute. Able to assign multiple classes to a single element:  class="alert-text severe-alert" ***

    -> ID 
        -> Similar to class selector, however there can only be one ID 

        <div id="title">The odin project</div>

        -> Example
        #title {
            color: red;
        }

        *** Syntax: uses a '#' followed by the case-sensitive value of ID. Use ID only when needed/sparingly ***

    -> Grouping
        -> when there are multiple elements that share some of their style declarations, we can group them via using a comma and newline.

        .read,
        .unread {
            color: red;
        }

        .read {
            /* other unique declarations */
        }

        .unread {
            /* other unique declarations */
        }

    -> Chaining Selectors
        -> able to chain classes as well as classes and id

        -> example
        <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
        <p class="subsection" id="preview">preview a post.</p>

        .subsection.header {
            color: red;
        }

        .subsection#preview {
            color: blue;
        }

        *** In general, can only chain up to one other type selector since an element cannot be two different types at once, such as chaining div and p ***
