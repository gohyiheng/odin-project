color: sets text color
background-color: sets background color
-> accepts acutal color names, HEX, RGB, HSL

------------------------------------------

font-family: single value, comma separated list of values
    -> font family like "Times New Roman"
            -> "" are used due to white space between words
    -> generic family like serif
    -> a browser will use the next one in the list if it does not support the first font, thus it is recommended to use a generic font family as fallback

font-size: sets size of fonts, e.g. 22px

font-weight: affects boldness of the text, assuming that the font supports the boldness.
    -> value can be a keyword or number between 1-1000 
        -> e.g. bold
        -> 700 = bold 

text-align: aligns the text with an element
    -> e.g. center

------------------------------------------  

height & width: 
    -> default would be original image specifications.
    -> auto allows for changing either the height or width while keeping the proportions.
